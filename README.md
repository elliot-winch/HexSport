<h1> Hello there </h1>

It seems you've stumbled on my WIP Unity Project. It's a turn based sports game, combining X-Com tactics and FIFA-esque team management. My main inspirtation is Dreadball, a tabletop minatures game by Mantic Games.

Come back by early March, when I hope to have a greybox protoytype up and running. 

Are you a 3D artit and want to help out? Shoot me an email: erw331@nyu.edu

To do:

Next:
UI : In placing mode: Need to be able to place any remaining player (cycle with tab). Needs t be able to move already placed contestant. Needs to be able to decide when to let next team go. Display which team is placing.

Weapons and Melee and Armour and Items and Grenades, along with all the Actions / UI to operate these things.

Find a 3D artist. Temp: get stand in models for different types. 

Special actions (will be saved in ContestantData).

Future:
Cover: Right now a Contestant is either seen or not. Change field of view algo. to A* based, and sample multiple paths to decide if in cover / poss. 

Interceptions: A Contestant between two throwing Contestants has a chance to intercept.

Campaign Mode: Create in-between game scenes, where you manage your team / see leagues etc.

Maps: More maps that load from a file.
-> Teams: Some maps can have more than two teams.
