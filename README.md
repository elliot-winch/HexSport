Game Design: Turns limit / score limit? What ends a turn? More possible actions. Grenades / grenade view.
Different player types can do different things. 

Generalise maps.
Generalise team number.

Create in-between game scenes. 

Different sized capsules (temp) for different player types. 

In placing mode: Need to be able to place any remaining player (cycle with tab). Needs t be able to move already placed contestant. Needs to be able to decide when to let next team go. Display which team is placing.
